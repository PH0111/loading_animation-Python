# Manim Loading Animations 🎬

A small collection of **loading / waiting animations** created using **Manim Community Edition**.
Each animation is implemented as an independent `Scene` and can be rendered separately.

These loaders are useful for:
- Intro/outro animations
- UI or app mockups
- Practice with Manim transforms and rate functions
- Visual experiments
